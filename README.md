# Before running the project

- Create a <a href="https://plant.id/">plant.id</a> account and get an api key.
- Create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixswutBQfvE">set up</a> and a cloudinary account.

# Required Dependencies

- http
- image_picker
- flutter_dotenv

## Notes
- The `PlantApi` & `Diagnosis Box` classes are refactorable.
- Move them to separate files and just import them (don't forget to move the required imports with them too).
- And yes you can get the api keys if you looked inside the commit history, but please don't.
